# SharpCryptography
Reusable/Non-allow cryptography methods for C#.

# DO NOT USE RIGHT NOW!
This library is temporarily just a wrapper for .NET encryption/hashing classes.

I want to use non/least-alloc cryptography in my main project, but right now I am in big hurry and don't have time for implementing it.

As soon as I have more time, I will focus on this thing.
